# About this Project
This project is aimed to show how profitable MvM would be for a user trying to get the Golden Frying Pan. This program uses **stone-cold math** to calculate the probability of profit and loss. It will then show a plethora of information once the simulation has completed. The user can define the prices of all items, or stick with the default prices taken directly from Backpack.TF upon startup.

**I take no responsibility for any financial decisions you might make based on this program!**
